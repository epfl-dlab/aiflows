ü§ñüåä **aiFlows** embodies the <a href="assets/flows_paper.pdf">*Flows*</a> abstraction (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01285">arXiv</a>) and greatly simplifies the design and implementation of complex (work)Flows involving humans, AI systems, and tools. It enables:

- üß© Modularity: Flows can be stacked like LEGO blocks into arbitrarily nested structures with the complexity hidden behind a message-based interface
- ü§ù Reusability: Flows can be shared publicly on the FlowVerse, readily downloaded and reused as part of different Flows
- üîÄ Concurrency: Being consistent with the Actor model of concurrent computation, Flows are concurrency friendly ‚Äì a necessary feature for a multi-agent future

## Flows in a Nutshell

The framework is centered around *Flows* and *messages*.
Flows represent the fundamental building block of computation. They are independent, self-contained, goal-driven entities able to complete a semantically meaningful unit of work.
To exchange information, Flows communicate via a standardized message-based interface. Messages can be of any type the recipient Flow can process.

The second column depicts Atomic Flows, effectively minimal wrappers around tools constructed from the example tools. The third column depicts examples of Composite Flows defining structured interaction between <em>Atomic</em> or <em>Composite</em> Flows. The fourth column illustrates a specific <em>Composite</em> competitive coding Flow as those used in the experiments in the paper. The fifth column outlines the structure of a hypothetical Flow, defining a meta-reasoning process that could support autonomous behavior.

## FlowVerse in a Nutshell
The FlowVerse is a repository of Flows (powered by the ü§ó HuggingFace hub) created and shared by our community for everyone to use! With aiFlows, Flows can be readily downloaded, used, extended, or composed into novel, more complex Flows. For instance, sharing a Flow that uses only API-based tools (tools subsume models in the Flows abstraction) is as simple as sharing a config file (e.g., [here](https://huggingface.co/aiflows/AutoGPTFlowModule) is the AutoGPT Flow on FlowVerse). For the ones using ChatGPT, you could think of them as completely customizable open-source GPTs(++).

The FlowVerse is continuously growing. To explore the currently available Flows, check out the ü§≤‚îÇflow-sharing Forum on the Discord [server](https://discord.gg/yFZkpD2HAh). Additionally, the _Tutorials_ and _Detailed Examples_ in the [Getting Started](https://epfl-dlab.github.io/aiflows/docs/built_with_sphinx/html/getting_started/index.html) sections cover some of the Flows we provide in more detail (e.g., the ChatAtomicFlow and QA, VisionAtomicFlow and VisualQA, ReAct and ReAct with human feedback, AutoGPT, etc.).

## Why should I use aiFlows?
AI is set to revolutionize the way we work. Our mission is to support AI researchers and to allow them to seamlessly share advancements with practitioners. This will establish a feedback loop, guiding progress toward beneficial directions while ensuring that everyone can freely access and benefit from the next-generation AI tools.

#### As a researcher, you will benefit from:
- The ability to design, implement, and study arbitrarily complex interactions
- Complete control and customizability (e.g., the tools, the specific Flows and the information they have access to, the choice of models and their deployment, etc.)
- The ability to readily reproduce, reuse, or build on top of Flows shared on the FlowVerse and systematically study them across different settings (the infrastructure in the <a href="https://github.com/epfl-dlab/cc_flows">cc_flows</a> repository could be a useful starting point in future studies)
- The ability to readily make your work accessible to practitioners and other researchers and access their feedback.

#### As a practitioner, you will benefit from the:
- The ability to design and implement arbitrarily complex interactions
- Complete control and customizability (e.g., the tools, the specific Flows and the information they have access to, the choice of models and their deployment, etc.)
- The ability to readily reuse or build on top of Flows shared on the FlowVerse
- Direct access to any advancements in the field.

To develop the next-generation AI tools and at the same time maximally benefit from them, developers and researchers need to have complete control over their workflows -- aiFlows strives to empower you to make each Flow your own! See the [contribute](#contribute) section for more information.

pip install -e .
```
</details>


## Getting Started

### [Quick start (üïì 5 min)](./website/public/docs/getting_started/Quick_Start/quick_start.md)

Here, you'll see how you can run inference with your first question-answering Flow, and you can trivially change between vastly different question-answering Flows thanks to the modular abstraction and FlowVerse!

### [Tutorial (üïì 20 min)](./website/public/docs/getting_started/Tutorial/tutorial_landing_page.md)

In this tutorial, we introduce you to the library's features through a walkthrough of how to build useful Flows of gradually increasing complexity. Starting from a vanilla QA Flow, we'll first extend it to a ReAct Flow, then ReAct with human feedback, and finish the tutorial with a version of AutoGPT!

### [Developer's Guide (üïì 10 min)](./website/public/docs/getting_started/developer_guide/developper_guide_landing_page.md)

We are constantly optimizing our Flow development workflow (pun intended:). In this short guide, we share our best tips so that you don't have to learn the hard way.

### [Detailed Examples](./website/public/docs/getting_started/detailed_examples/detailed_example_landing_page.md)

Many of the recently proposed prompting and collaboration strategies involving tools, humans, and AI models are, in essence, specific Flows (see the figure below). In the link above, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of how to build some representative workflows.

## Contribute

As mentioned above, our goal is to make Flows a community-driven project that will benefit researchers and developers alike (see the [Why should I use aiFlows?](#why-should-i-use-aiflows) section), and to achieve this goal, we need your help.

You can become a part of the project in a few ways:
- contribute to the aiFlows codebase: this will directly improve the library and benefit everyone using it
- contribute to the FlowVerse: by making your work accessible to everyone, others might improve your work and build on it, or you can build on others' work
- use the library in your creative projects, push it to its limits, and share your feedback: the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the best way to identify promising directions, as well as important missing features, is by experimenting
- last but not least, ‚≠ê the repository and üì£ share aiFlows with your friends and colleagues; spread the word ‚ù§Ô∏è

We will support the community in the best way we can but also lead by example. In the coming weeks, we will share:
  - a roadmap for the library (FlowViz; FlowStudio; improve flexibility, developer experience, and support for concurrency, etc. -- feedback and help would be greatly appreciated!)
  - write-ups outlining features, ideas, and our long-term vision for Flows -- we encourage you to pick up any of these and start working on them in whatever way you see fit
  - a version of JARVIS -- your fully customizable open-source version of ChatGPT+(++), which we will continue building in public! We hope that this excites you as much as it excites us, and JARVIS will become one of those useful projects that will constantly push the boundaries of what's possible with Flows

We have tried to find a way for anyone to benefit by contributing to the project. The <a href="https://epfl-dlab.github.io/aiflows/docs/built_with_sphinx/html/contributing_info/contribute_index.html">Contribution Guide</a> describes our envisioned workflows in more detail (we would love to hear your feedback on this -- the Discord [server](https://discord.gg/yFZkpD2HAh) already has a channel for it :)).

In a nutshell, this is just the beginning, and we have a long way to go. Stay tuned, and let's work on a great (open-source) AI future together!

## JARVIS V0
Explore our [JARVIS V0 Tutorial](./examples/Jarvis/Introduction_to_Jarvis.md):  a general purpose agent built upon `aiflows`, empowered by a hierarchical structure of large language models and tools including a code interpreter. At a high level, Jarvis takes in tasks in natural language, and achieve the task by making plans, writing and executing code.

### JARVIS V0 Demo
You can find a demo of JARVIS V0 in [examples/run_jarvis.py](./examples/Jarvis/run_Jarvis.py).

To run:
```shell
cd examples/Jarvis
python run_Jarvis.py
```

### How can I contribute to JARVIS?
Our current iteration, V0 of JARVIS, acknowledges its potential for improvement on various fronts. We recognize that there are numerous areas where enhancements can be made. Therefore, **we eagerly welcome any and all contributions to elevate the capabilities and performance of JARVIS**. Your insights and efforts play a vital role in shaping the future iterations of this system. Let's collaborate to unlock the full potential of JARVIS! üöÄ

Here are some of the areas where we would like to see improvements:

- **Feedback, Feedback, Feedback**: We would like to hear your feedback on JARVIS! What do you like about JARVIS? What do you dislike about JARVIS? What do you think can be improved? What do you think can be added? We would like to hear your thoughts!

- **JARVIS Tutorials & Documentation**: We would like to provide more tutorials and documentation for JARVIS, so that users can get started with JARVIS more easily. We would also like to provide more examples of JARVIS in action, so that users can get a better understanding of JARVIS. Feel free to contribute !

- **JARVIS General Structure**: Do you have any thoughts on the general structure of JARVIS? Is there any way to make it more efficient (e.g, less calls to the LLM)? Is there any way to make it more general? We would like to hear your thoughts!

- **Memory Management : Rething the memory management mechanisms**: 
  - We are currently using a workaround for the token limitations of the LLM APIs, we are using a sliding window to crop the chat history, and we are using external memory files to store the memory of the flows. This is not ideal, we should be able to have **more efficient memory management mechanisms** (e.g., Vector Store Database)
  - The full content of the memory files are injected in the prompts. This can still make JARVIS eventually fail (due to the token limitations of the LLM APIs). We should be able to **inject only the necessary part of the memory** to the prompts.
  - **Develop mechanisms to work with a larger codebase** (saving and structuring the code library like an actual library, instead of a single file). How can we make the controller aware of the code library? How can we make the controller aware of the code library's structure? How can we make the controller aware of the code library's content?

- **Clear up prompts**: Improving the clarity of prompts is crucial. Consider the option of incorporating more examples instead of relying solely on natural language instructions. Are there alternative approaches to enhance the straightforwardness of prompts? Another issue involves non-json parsable results from LLM calls, currently addressed by specifying in the system prompt that the output should be json parsable. If the output falls short, the LLM is recalled with an instruction to reformat the answer. Beyond instructions, exploring alternative strategies to tackle this issue is essential. Valuable insights and contributions are welcome in refining this process.

You can also check out a more extensive list of potential improvements in the **Future Improvements** section of the [JARVIS V0 Tutorial](./examples/Jarvis/Introduction_to_Jarvis.md).
