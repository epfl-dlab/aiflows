Model selection depends on the provided `api_infos`. Additional models can be added for different backends, following LiteLLM's naming conventions (refer to LiteLLM's supported providers and model names [here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)). For instance, with an Anthropic API key and a desire to use \"claude-2,\" one would check Anthropic's model details [here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic#model-details).
