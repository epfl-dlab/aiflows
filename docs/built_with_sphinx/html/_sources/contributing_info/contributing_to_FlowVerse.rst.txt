Recommended Workflow for Contributing to a Flow on the FlowVerse
================================================================

**1. Check Existing Flows & Talk to the Community**
---------------------------------------------------

Before initiating a new Flow, take a moment to explore whether a similar Flow already exists. Delve into our vibrant community on ðŸ¤²â”‚flow-sharing 
in Discord to check for existing Flows or reach out to the community on ðŸŒŠðŸ”®â”‚flow-verse. 

If the desired Flow doesn't exist, consider crafting a new post in our Discord's ðŸ¤²â”‚flow-sharing. Share detailed information about the Flow you aim to implement 
and let the community know about your initiative. ðŸ¤²â”‚flow-sharing serves as an excellent platform to engage in discussions, seek feedback, receive assistance, and showcase your Flow. 
Utilize this space to not only introduce your idea but also to foster collaboration, gather insights, and promote your Flow within the community.

**2. Developing Your Flow - Creating or Enhancing for Contribution**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether you're cultivating a new Flow or contributing to an existing one, this step is your guide to navigate the intricate pathways of the FlowVerse. 
Consider checking out the :typical_developper_workflows: tutorial for examples on how to work on a new or existing Flow from the FlowVerse

**2.1. Create an Organized Workspace**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Optimize your workflow by following our recommendation to establish a centralized workspace. Create a dedicated folder to house all the flows you plan to interact with in the FlowVerse. 
Your structure should look like something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    â”œâ”€â”€ workspace-using-your-flows
    â””â”€â”€ flow_modules
        â”œâ”€â”€ Flow1
        â”œâ”€â”€ Flow2
        â”œâ”€â”€ ...

**2.2 Leverage the Flow Template**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider adopting our `Flow template <https://huggingface.co/aiflows/FlowModule>`_ as a solid foundation for your project. This recommended structure serves as a guide, 
enhancing consistency and facilitating a smoother collaborative experience. Also, check the `ChatFlowModule <https://huggingface.co/aiflows/ChatFlowModule>`_ for an example.

**2.3. Code With Precision**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Embrace our recommended coding standards, which serve as the backbone of a robust project. Strive for code that is not only creative but 
also aligns with our :ref:`coding_standards`. This commitment ensures readability, maintainability, and alignment with the broader coding community.

**2.5. Consider Automation for Documentation (Optional)**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For those inclined towards efficiency, exploring automation for documentation may prove beneficial. Refer to `this tutorial <./automating_documentation_flow.md>`_ for a comprehensive guide on 
automating the documentation processâ€”a strategic move for systematic project management.

**3. Engage in Dialogue on Discord**
-------------------------------------

Engage in meaningful discussions within the `Discord community <https://discord.gg/yFZkpD2HAh>`_. Sharing your progress, seeking advice, and actively participating in conversations 
not only enhances your project but also contributes to the collaborative ethos of the community.

Remember, each contribution, no matter how small, adds to the vibrant tapestry of the FlowVerse. Happy coding! ðŸš€âœ¨
