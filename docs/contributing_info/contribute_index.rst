**Preface**
----------------------------------------------
    Our goal is to make Flows a community-driven project that will benefit researchers and developers alike  (see the `Why should I use aiFlows?`_ ) and to achieve this goal, we need your help.


    You can become a part of the project in a few ways:

    - contribute to the aiFlows codebase: this will directly improve the library and benefit everyone using it
    - contribute to the FlowVerse: by making your work accessible to everyone, others might improve your work and build on it, or you can build on others' work
    - use the library in your creative projects, push it to its limits, and share your feedback: the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the best way to identify promising directions, as well as important missing features, is by experimenting
    - last but not least, star the repository and shout out aiFlows with your friends and colleagues; spread the word with love

    .. _

    We will support the community in the best way we can but also lead by example. In the coming weeks, we will share:

    - a roadmap for the library (FlowViz; FlowStudio; improve flexibility, developer experience, and support for concurrency, etc. -- feedback and help would be greatly appreciated!)
    - write-ups outlining features, ideas, and our long-term vision for Flows -- we encourage you to pick up any of these and start working on them in whatever way you see fit
    - a version of JARVIS -- your fully customizable open-source version of ChatGPT+(++), which we will continue building in public! We hope that this excites you as much as it excites us, and JARVIS will become one of those useful projects that will constantly push the boundaries of what's possible with Flows

    .. _

    We have tried to find a way for anyone to benefit by contributing to the project. Below we describe the envisioned workflows in more detail (we would love to hear your feedback on this -- the Discord `server <https://discord.gg/yFZkpD2HAh>`_ already has a channel for it :)).

    In a nutshell, this is just the beginning, and we have a long way to go. Stay tuned, and let's work on a great (open-source) AI future together!
